- Git for version control
- Arduino IDE (for ESP32 development)
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and IoT concepts

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/demo_chuong4_1.git
   cd demo_chuong4_1
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment templates
   cp app/.env.example app/.env
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   cp firmware/secrets.h.template firmware/secrets.h
   ```

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test improvements

### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure
- Implement proper prop types with TypeScript interfaces
- Use custom hooks for complex logic

#### Arduino/C++
- Follow Arduino IDE formatting standards
- Use clear variable names and comments
- Implement proper error handling
- Document hardware connections in comments

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:app

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Requirements
- Write tests for new components and hooks
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names

### Hardware Testing
- Test with real ESP32 devices when possible
- Verify MQTT communication works correctly
- Test LED control functionality
- Document any hardware-specific issues

## üìö Documentation

### What to Document
- New features and their usage
- API changes and additions
- Hardware setup modifications
- Configuration options
- Known issues and workarounds

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Update README files for significant changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## üìù Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Test Your Changes**
